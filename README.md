# Visual Sorting App
  
Visual demonstration of common sorting algorithms, designed using React and Redux (in progress).  
Created using create-react-app.  

For the most stable version, please visit my GitHub pages site (linked in the about section), or clone the gh-pages branch.
  
### Features
  
-state managed by Redux store and passed to React component props as needed  
-utilizes composed reducers to improve modularity and scalability, also employs redux-thunk middleware to allow for the dispatch of asynchronous actions  
-demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction  
-demonstrates understanding on javascript array methods such as mapping and spread operator  
  
  
*only bubble sort has been implemented so far, all other buttons randomize the array for now*.
